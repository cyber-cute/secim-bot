# Discord Election Bot

This Discord bot is made to follow the election results in Turkey. 

## Installation
For the bot to work, you need install packages and to create an .env file and add your bot's token to it. The .env file should be as follows:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=""
```
Also, since an api is made using python bs4, don't forget to go into the api folder and run the python code.

Thank you [Tolgchu](https://github.com/Tolga1452) for the discord.js template for this bot
